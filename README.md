UPDATE: This repository is now deprecated. Ugly solution, but it is difficult to get rid of the history and keep everyone else (who has already branched) have a clean history as well.  The past git history was creating a lot of bloat (hundreds of MB large), due to files that were deleted from the very first commit and repackaged into resources.zip. This page kept in place for the record.

Anyhow, go here to the new repository:
